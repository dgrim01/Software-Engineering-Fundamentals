        <h2>Short Bio</h2>
        <div class="container-fluid" id="info">
        <p>
          Motivated and aspiring Software Engineer with 3 months of experience
          in Python Including OOP. Also with a Computing degree earned during
          the challenging years of the COVID-19 pandemic, I showcase
          determination and hard work. Adapting to remote learning, I graduated
          successfully, reflecting resilience and commitment. Versatile in
          professional settings, I excel in teamwork and communication,
          demonstrated through team projects and a solo final year project,
          highlighting technical proficiency and independent problem-solving.

        <p>
          I have wanted to be a Software Engineer or something similar since I
          was around 13 to 15 years old. My interest was initially sparked when
          I was playing the first Watch Dogs game, specifically by the character
          T-Bone. When I googled the game's wiki page, I discovered that T-Bone
          was a Software Engineer before the events of the game. Since then I
          looked more into what the job entails I found it peaked my interest
          further.

          Being a software engineer is like being a digital architect, crafting
          intricate worlds of code that power everything from your favorite apps
          to cutting-edge technologies. It's about diving into the heart of
          innovation, solving puzzles, and building the future one line of code
          at a time. You get to collaborate with brilliant minds, tackle
          challenges head-on, and create solutions that shape how we live, work,
          and play in the digital age.
