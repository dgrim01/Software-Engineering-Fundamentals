    <h2>Short Bio</h2>
    <p>
        Motivated and aspiring Software Engineer with 3 months of experience in Python Including OOP. Also with a Computing degree earned during the challenging years of the COVID-19 pandemic, I showcase determination and hard work. Adapting to remote learning, I graduated successfully, reflecting resilience and commitment. Versatile in professional settings, I excel in teamwork and communication, demonstrated through team projects and a solo final year project, highlighting technical proficiency and independent problem-solving.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have wanted to be a Software Engineer or something similar since I was around 13 to 15 years old. My interest was initially sparked when I was playing the first Watch Dogs game, specifically by the character T-Bone. When I googled the game's wiki page, I discovered that T-Bone was a Software Engineer before the events of the game. Since then I looked more into what the job entails I found it peaked my interest further.

        Being a software engineer is like being a digital architect, crafting intricate worlds of code that power everything from your favorite apps to cutting-edge technologies. It's about diving into the heart of innovation, solving puzzles, and building the future one line of code at a time. You get to collaborate with brilliant minds, tackle challenges head-on, and create solutions that shape how we live, work, and play in the digital age.
